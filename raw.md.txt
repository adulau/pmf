               Programming Methodology Framework aka PMF
            draft-dulaunoy-programming-methodology-framework

Abstract

   This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also
   known under the PMF methodology.  The methodology is based on the
   manifesto written by Zed A.  Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which
   describes a natural approach to software engineering with a strong
   focus on the act of programming.  The PMF methodology uses a soft
   naming to allow for a non-partisan reference to official engineering
   or project documents describing one of the most used software
   engineering methodologies.

1.  Introduction

   In 2011, Zed A.  Shaw published a blog post which describes:

   I think I'm going to create the ultimate software development
   methodology.  It'll be revolutionary compared to others because it
   will focus on the one thing that gets software done.  Its entire
   focus will be this one, glorious, completely useful activity for
   writing software.  It's name even embodies the perfection of this
   programming methodology.

   The PMF methodology was published as a manifesto later
   [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO].  The manifesto clearly describes the
   focus on programming to avoid the surrounding management overhead and
   pivot towards the delivery of the software.  The
   [THE-TAO-OF-PROGRAMMING] describes similar methodologies which
   strongly focus on coding, scripting and programming.

   The overall concept of PMF methodology follows the following process:

   o  Compose a list of features to be implemented and use an iterative
      programming process.

   o  Enhance said features using trial and error programming.

   o  Orchestrate your testing and integration processes using pragmatic
      programming.

   Repeat the above process until the software is delivered.

   A simplified overview of the process can be described as follow:

1.1.  Management and PMF methodology

   A simple management process is a requirement of the PMF methodology.
   The management process is meant to be complementary instead of
   interfering with the programming aspect and solely serves to support
   the PMF methodology.

   o  Collect requirements of the users/customers.

   o  Provide programmers with the desired requirements.

   o  Review whether the software to be delivered matches the
      requirements.

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Security Considerations

   Secure and defensive programming can only come by practicing
   programming and this also includes the act of simplifying or removing
   code to reduce the attack surface.

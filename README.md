# PMF Methodology

This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also
known under the PMF methodology.  The methodology is based on [the
manifesto written by Zed A.  Shaw](http://programming-motherfucker.com) which
describes a natural approach to software engineering with a strong
focus on the act of programming.  The PM methodology uses a soft
naming to allow for a non-partisan reference to official engineering
or project documents describing one of the most used software
engineering methodologies.
